Pythia Central Localization Daemon
=================

This is **non-production** code directly from the Pythia project, used on the GAMMON testbed.

This daemon operates on the detected events written to the central database by the Pythia agents. It produces possible faulty links and ranges for metrics for delays, losses and reordering.
