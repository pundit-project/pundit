Pundit Agent Code
=================

This is **non-production** code, rewritten for the PuNDIT project.

This code is meant to be deployed on the perfSONAR agents.

Note: Some files contain place-holders meant to the user to fill in the details.
Currently, bin/localization_traceroute_daemon.pl and etc/pundit-agent.conf contain
place-holders. Find them by searching for the word "here" within angle brackets (<>).
