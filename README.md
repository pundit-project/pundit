The PuNDIT research project is funded by the National Science Foundation under award numbers 1440571 and 1440585

Duration: September 2014 - August 2016
Principal Investigators

Shawn McKee, University of Michigan (smckeeumich.edu)

PuNDIT will integrate and enhance several software tools needed by the High Energy Physics (HEP) community to provide an infrastructure for identifying, diagnosing and localizing network problems. In particular, the core of PuNDIT is the Pythia tool that uses perfSONAR data to detect, identify and locate network performance problems. The Pythia algorithms, originally based on one-way latency and packet loss, will be re-implemented incorporating the lessons learned from its first release and augmenting those algorithms with additional metrics from perfSONAR throughput and traceroute measurements.  The PuNDIT infrastructure will build upon other popular open-source tools including smokeping, ESnet's Monitoring and Debugging Dashboard (MaDDash) and the Open Monitoring Distribution (OMD) to provide a user-friendly network diagnosis framework.
